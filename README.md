# Extension-esque-MonoGameLibrary
A modular, dependency-injected game framework built on **MonoGame**. Designed for maintainability, testability, and platform abstraction.

The MonoGameLibrary provides a clean separation of concerns with Core (platform-agnostic), Adapters (MonoGame bindings), and Extensions (optional modules). It features explicit dependency injection, standardized lifecycle interfaces, and a flexible host system for building maintainable and testable games. 

## Features

### Core (Platform-Agnostic)
- Interfaces for essential services: `IContentService`, `IThreadPool`, `ILogger`
- Base lifecycle contracts for consistent system behavior

### Adapters (Bindings)
- `MonoGameContentService`: Streamlined content loading
- `MonoGameAdapter`: Bridge between library systems and MonoGame’s `Game` class
- `GumService`: Integration with the Gum UI framework

### Extensions (Optional Modules)
- **Audio**: Sound effect and music management
- **Input**: Unified input handling across devices
- **Scenes**: Scene graph and state management
- **Graphics**: Sprite rendering, texture atlases, tilemaps
- **...**

### Infrastructure
- **Thread-Safe Host**: `GameHost` with operation counting and graceful shutdown
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Single `OnError` callback for module exceptions
- **Composition Root**: Clear setup flow for wiring dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK or higher](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [MonoGame 3.8+](https://www.monogame.net/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (choose one mirror)
- GitHub
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mushroomcowisheggs/Extension-esque-MonoGameLibrary.git
   ```
- Codeberg
   ```bash
   git clone https://codeberg.org/Mushroomcowisheggs/Extension-esque-MonoGameLibrary.git
   ```
2. Add a reference to `MonoGameLibrary.csproj` in your game project.

### Basic Usage (Composition Root)
```csharp
using MonoGameLibrary.Core.Hosting;
using MonoGameLibrary.Adapters.MonoGame;
using MonoGameLibrary.Extensions;

var builder = new GameBuilder();
builder.UseDefaultServices();
builder.UseAudio();
builder.UseInput();

var serviceContent = new MonoGameContentService(Content);
builder.RegisterService<IContentService>(serviceContent);

var host = builder.Build();
host.OnError = delegate(exception, context) { LogError(exception, context); }

// Add modules
host.AddModule(new SceneModule(serviceScene));
// ...
```

For a full example, see the [Samples](https://github.com/mushroomcowisheggs/Extension-esque-MonoGameLibrary.Samples).

## Why choose this library?
It shines when you need structure without bloat. Unlike all-in-one frameworks, it avoids “magic”—every system is visible and replaceable. It’s ideal for developers who want to own their architecture and iterate safely.

### Alternatives & Comparison

| Solution | Best For | Trade-offs |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Raw MonoGame** | Quick prototypes, maximum control | No built-in architecture; scalability requires custom scaffolding |
| **MonoGame.Extended** | Rich 2D features (physics, particles) | Larger API surface; less emphasis on DI/lifecycle patterns |
| **Stride/A MonoGame Fork** | Cutting-edge graphics, editor workflows | Steeper learning curve; heavier runtime footprint |
| **This Library** | Maintainable, testable 2D games | Requires understanding DI concepts; fewer out-of-the-box features |

## Why might you NOT use this Library?

This library is purpose-built for projects where **long-term maintainability** and **clean architecture** matter. For certain scenarios, especially rapid prototyping or small-scale games, it may introduce unnecessary overhead.

| Scenario | Why You Might Skip This Library |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Game Jams & 48-hour prototypes** | You need to ship fast with minimal ceremony. Raw MonoGame or a simple game loop gives you more velocity. |
| **Tiny games (< 1000 lines)** | The DI setup, module system, and lifecycle interfaces add friction for trivial projects. |
| **Learning MonoGame for the first time** | Start with raw MonoGame to understand the basics before layering abstractions. |
| **One-off experimental projects** | If you won't revisit the code later, the architectural benefits aren't worth the upfront cost. |

In short: if your goal is to **make something quickly and move on**, this library is probably overkill. But if you plan to grow, refactor, or collaborate on a game over months or years, the investment pays off.
